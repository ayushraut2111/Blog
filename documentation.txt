In this assignment i made a backend for writing blogs.There are 2 api for blogs in this project one for the authenticated user to 
create,read,update,delete their blogs and with the help of another api anyone can read all the blogs and this 2nd api only
supports readonly method so no one can modify the blogs from this api.
Pagination is also used to view the result, i have set limit to 10 so only 10 results are shown at a time.

This backend includes user signup and login functionalities which is implemented with the help of dj-rest-auth, backend is authenticated 
with JWT authentication so for creating,updating,deleting blogs you need access token to make requests. so as soon as you login with the help
of login api, it returns access token and refresh token in response. So with the help of access token you can make requests and after access token 
expires, with the help of refresh token you can request new access token and again make requests.
By default access token is valid for only 5 minutes and refresh token is valid for 1 day,so after every 5 minutes you have to again regenerate access
token with the help of refresh token.

How to run the project :-
1. first clone the Blog repository and after cloning you will get "requirements.txt" file so first install all the reuqirements to run the project.
2. Open Blog folder and run command "python manage.py runserver" to run the backend.
3. Inside Blog folder you will get "blogapp" folder, inside this folder there is all the codes written for the backend.
3. In blogapp folder - DB tables are defined in models.py, api code is written in views.py, in urls.py we have all the urls to access api's.


How to test the backend :-
For testing the backend you can use postman.

1. For user registration :-

url= "http://127.0.0.1:8000/dj-rest-auth/registration/"

for registration you have to send post request to the above url with user information in below json format.

{
    "username": "",
    "email": "",
    "password1": "",
    "password2": ""
}

2. For Login :-

url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/dj-rest-auth/login/"


for logging in send post request to above url with user info in json format that is shown below,

{
    "username": "",
    "password": ""
}
 after loggin in you will get access token and refersh token in response for making request to the server.

3. For logout :-

url= "http://127.0.0.1:8000/dj-rest-auth/logout/"

for logging out send post request on the above url and you will logout.

4. For refreshing token :-

url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/refresh/"

to get new token send post request to the above url with refresh token in json format defined below

{
    "refresh": ""
}


After logging in you can now make request to the blog api :-



1. To check the authenticated api for creating,reading,updating,deleting blogs :-

first add access token in your header and make requests on the below api because this api is authenticated with jwt authentication

url= "http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/"

for posting blogs make post request on above url in json format shown below 

{
    "Title": "",
    "Body": ""

}

for deleting blogs make delete request on the url with id of the post 
url= "http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/id/"



2. To get all the blogs there is another api, anyone can make request on this api to read all the blogs :-

url= "http://127.0.0.1:8000/getall/"

This url only supports get request only so no one can modify with this api.
